# cron_setup.rb
#
# This is an automated way of ensuring that entries exist in a server's
# crontab file. We want to deploy a set of cron jobs to all servers,
# and ensure that those jobs make it into the crontab file so they run
# on schedule. All of this should be done programmatically, so we don't
# have to manually log in to each machine and set up the crontab.
#
# The following entry would make the disk_check script run
# every day at 4:00 AM.
#
# 0 4 * * * ruby /var/cron/disk_check.rb
#
# Note: You can run crontab -u &lt;user&gt; -l to read the crontab file
# for a specific user, but only if you have root privileges.
# As root, you can also run crontab -u &lt;user&gt; filename to have
# crontab replace the user's cron with the file you specify.
